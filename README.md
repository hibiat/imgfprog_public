# Multimodal Machine Learning-Based Prognostication for Traumatic Brain Injury


The details of code usage will become available soon. 

## About the Project 
This repository presents the code for a novel machine learning (ML)-based prognostic model for traumatic brain injury (TBI). The paper is available as open-access [[link](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/neu.2023.0446)]. Our developed model exhibits superior predictive ability for six-month outcomes compared to existing models depending solely on clinical variables or utilizing CT scores. Unlike previous studies, our model removes the need for manual CT assessments, possibly mitigating accessor bias. The development of clinical decision support software founded on our algorithm might help clinicians to promptly and accurately prognosticate TBI patients, regardless of clinician’s expertise level, thus contributing to timely treatment and enhanced patient outcomes.

### Requirements
- Python 3.9
- PyTorch 1.13.0
- Cuda 11.7
- Pytorch Image Models (timm)
- Pydicom
- OpenCV
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Dataset 
We used CENTER-TBI dataset.
CENTER-TBI encourages data sharing, and there is a data sharing statement published: https://center-tbi.eu/data/sharing. Individual participant data, including data dictionary and analysis scripts will be available immediately following publication, conditional to approved study proposal. Data will be available to researchers who provide a methodologically sound study proposal that is approved by the management committee to achieve the aims in the approved proposal. Proposals can be submitted online at https://www.center­tbi.eu/data. A data access agreement is required, and all access must comply with regulatory restrictions imposed on the original study.
